 * To delete a comment reaction, delete its DB entry.
 * A comment reaction can not be edited, or better yet should not be edited.
 * If a user wants to apply a different comment reaction, he or she can delete the first one, and add a new one.
 * <p>
 * A user can have more then one comment reaction on a given comment.
 * The business layer wil need to decide how to deal with that situation and which combinations are allowed if any.
